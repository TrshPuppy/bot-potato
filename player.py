# We will want to do the comparison


# (Game.num_passes - last_passed >= Game.min_passes_between)
# to determine if the pass is allowed between two players.
# Game.min_passes_between shoud also scale with the number of players in a game.

# Game has a current_player that should point
# to the Player that has the potato.
# The idea behind Game._run() is that it runs every second
# and checks the game state, i.e. timeouts, and does what it do.
# Within that loop, _run() should be able to check
# self.current_player and determine whether player
# timeout has happened by
# checking (int(time.time()) - self.current_player.time_received > self.current_player.player_timeout).
# If player timeout has not happened, it can send a courtesy chat that says
# "Player A has X seconds left to pass!"
